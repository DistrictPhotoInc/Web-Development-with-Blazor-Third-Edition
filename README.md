## About the book(long descriptio in EPIC)

Web Development with Blazor is your essential guide to building and deploying interactive web applications in C# – without relying on JavaScript.

Written by an early Blazor adopter and updated for .NET 8, this book takes you through the end-to-end development of an example app, helping you to overcome common challenges along the way. You’ll pick up both Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly and discover cutting-edge tools to enrich your development experience.

Responding to evolving needs, this edition introduces flexible hosting models, allowing you to mix and match hosting approaches to create flexible and scalable Blazor applications. It also presents the new Blazor templates, which provide ready-made solutions to simplify and expedite development. You'll learn about the game-changing server-side rendering (SSR), a hybrid hosting model blending the strengths of Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly, as well as streaming rendering, a new technique that boosts the performance and user experience of Blazor apps.

By the end of this book, you'll have the confidence you need to create and deploy production-ready Blazor applications using best practices, along with a big-picture view of the Blazor landscape.
